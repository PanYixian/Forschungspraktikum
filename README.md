# Forschungspraktikum
codes for Forschungspraktikum

Project_description:

    task1: same geometry, but different atomic ordering
    task2: same geometry, but different order and global rotation/translation different
    task3: 2 MD-snapshots of the same molecule, i.e. slightly different geometry + different order
    task4: parts of the molecule really different
    task5: addition if there is time, H replaced by CH3 or similar


Record of paper-reading

paper1:
MOLFIT: A computer program for molecular superposition (P.K.Redington, Computers & Chemistry, Volume 16, Issue 3, 1992, 217-222)
- direct noniterative method for determining the unitary matrix which superimposes one structure upon the other
- refine by improved SS algorithm (1991, Sippl & Stegbuchner)
- !!! place the molecule centers at the origin (0,0,0)
