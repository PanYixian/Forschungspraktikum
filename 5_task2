//task2: same geometry, but different order and global rotation/translation different
//step1: read in 1st and 2nd file, calculate center of mass (centroid_0 and centroid_1)
//step2: translation of centroid_1 to centroid_0
//step3: calculate the relative atom-atom distances, reorder 2nd file
//step4: apply Kabsch algorithm
//step5: print the rotated 2nd file into a 3rd file (or rewrite 2nd file?)
